StayAwake
=========

This is a simple tray icon application which will stop a laptop or PC from producing a blank screen or hibernating.
I have found it very useful at work as every time my laptop goes to blank screen I need to relog in. This application
prevent this by effectively faking a mouse movement.

There are two configurable options available from the system tray icon pop-up form.
1) Time between mouse moves in seconds.
2) Activating or de-activating the mouse moves.

Hovering over the tray icon will show whether the application is active or not.

On my laptop it does not appear to move the mouse in any decernable way but it does prevent the screen locking.
